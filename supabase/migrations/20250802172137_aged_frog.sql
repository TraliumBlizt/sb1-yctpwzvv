/*
  # Relax RLS policies for anonymous operations

  **WARNING: This configuration is for development/testing purposes only**
  **NOT RECOMMENDED for production environments**

  1. Policy Changes
    - Allow anonymous users to insert transactions
    - Allow anonymous users to insert deposit proofs
    - Allow anonymous users to update user balances
    - Allow anonymous users to upload to deposit-proofs storage bucket

  2. Security Impact
    - Any anonymous user can insert data into these tables
    - No user-specific access control enforcement
    - Relies entirely on frontend validation (easily bypassed)

  3. Tables Affected
    - transactions
    - deposit_proofs  
    - users (for balance updates)
